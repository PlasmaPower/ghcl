# ghcl: GitHub CLone

Automatically fork, clone, and setup an upstream remote for a GitHub repository. By default, the master branch will track the upstream remote.

Intended as a "quick-start" for contributing to a GitHub repository.
More services such as GitLab and BitBucket are coming soonâ„¢. The code is ready for multiple services, but the APIs for them haven't been implemented.

## Installation

Currently, all methods of installation require building from source, and a working Rust installation.
To quickly setup Rust (and Cargo), use [rustup](https://rustup.rs).

- Through crates.io: `cargo install ghcl`
- Through GitHub:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/PlasmaPower/ghcl.git
  cd ghcl
  cargo build --release
  sudo cp target/release/ghcl /usr/bin # or just cargo install, to install for just your user
  ```

Contents (all of which are optional, and can be overriden by arguments):

| Key               | Type/valid values   | Description                                                                                    |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| organization      | String              | the organization to clone repositories to                                                      |
| track_upstream    | bool                | should the master branch be setup to track upstream? (if true, setup_upstream cannot be false) |
| setup_upstream    | bool                | should the upstream remote be created?                                                         |
| remote_name       | String              | the name of the upstream remote to create (only used if setup_upstream is true)                |
| origin_protocol   | HTTPS or SSH        | the protocol to use for the origin remote                                                      |
| upstream_protocol | HTTPS or SSH        | the protocol to use for the upstream remote (only used if setup_upstream is true)              |
| default_service   | only github for now | the service to use if the repository is in the form of "user/repository"                       |
| quiet             | bool                | should status messages be outputed?                                                            |
| fork_timeout      | integer             | the maximum total timeout for attempting to clone after a fork                                 |
| authentication    | map - see below     | authentication (usually username + password) for each service                                  |

Authentication is a map of service (currently only "github") to a username and password.
With GitHub, you can (and it's recommended to) use a personal access token with the "repo" permission instead of an actual password.
That way, it has limited permissions, and can be easily revoked.

Example config:

```yaml
organization: myOrg
track_upstream: false
setup_upstream: true
remote_name: my-upstream
origin_protocol: SSH
upstream_protocol: HTTPS
default_service: github
quiet: true
fork_timeout: 30
authentication:
  github:
    username: ExampleUser
    password: efbfd4e43d8e77c1dc24... # personal access token
```

## FAQ

### When I use ghcl, it freezes after "Cloning repository..."
That probably means your SSH agent is misconfigured.
I'm not sure why it causes a freeze, but to fix it, run `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`, or whatver your GitHub RSA key is.
You should also put that in your `.profile` or equivalent.

### This program doesn't fit my workflow!
This program is opinionated, and not intended to fit every workflow.
However, if it's just a small option that's missing, feel free to create an issue or pull request.
